      <h2>Welcome to Cyp's website, Cyp will talk about herself</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Cyprianne Jean A. Murillo, and I am a 2nd year college
        student currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have various hobbies and interests; I like art, technology, animals
        and I enjoy playing the bass as well as listening to music.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am at a point in my life where I am still quite confused as to what I
        truly want to do, self-discovery is such a wide spectrum.
      </p>

      <h3>I really like cats!</h3>
      <p>
        Cats are my favorite animal, and I have one of my own too! His name is
        Abbu like the monkey Abu from <i>Aladdin.</i> He is a grey-tuxedo
        British shorthair and Persian mix.
      </p>
      <p>
        This picture is not my cat, but it looks somehow similar to
        <span style="color: rgb(160, 214, 178)">Abbu</span>
      </p>
